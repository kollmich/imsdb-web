# Data & Methodology

The list of analysed movies reflects the [boxofficemojo's]: https://www.boxofficemojo.com/chart/top_lifetime_gross_adjusted/?adjust_gross_to=2020  chart of top grossing movies adjusted for inflation. Each movie has been analysed through subtitles publicly available for download at https://www.yifysubtitles.com. The webscraping and data handling processes were performed in Python, with the visualisations being developed in d3.js and Dash libraries. The charts are updated on a quarterly basis with the back-end code available in a separate [repository]: https://github.com/kollmich/imsdb-data.
